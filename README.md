# Quick Settings Plugin for KOReader

A native, clean, and highly customizable **Quick Settings Panel** for KOReader. This plugin combines a beautiful slider interface with an accessible control toggle panel.

This project is a hybrid merge of two excellent community resources, compiled and optimized using AI assistance:
*   **ZenUI Sliders:** Derived from [AnthonyGress/zen_ui.koplugin](https://github.com/AnthonyGress/zen_ui.koplugin).
*   **Quick Settings Logic:** Derived from the `2-quick-settings.lua` patch found in [qewer33/koreader-patches](https://github.com/qewer33/koreader-patches).

## 📌 Disclaimer & Purpose

> **Note:** This plugin was originally put together purely for my **personal use** to streamline my own e-reader workflow. It is being shared publicly here because members of the community asked for it. 
> 
> As a personal project maintained in my spare time, it is provided "as-is." While you are more than welcome to use, fork, or modify it, please keep in mind that official support or frequent updates are not guaranteed.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Integrated Panel:** Combines your main navigation bar, quick toggle buttons, and frontlight sliders into a single unified menu view.
*   **ZenUI Sliders:** Upgrades the native KOReader frontlight/warmth bars with smooth, gesture-friendly pill-and-circle sliders.
*   **Dynamic Grid Layout:** Displays a perfectly proportioned single row when you select up to 7 buttons. If you enable more than 7 items, the plugin automatically adds new rows to accommodate your selection cleanly.
*   **Extensive App Toggles:** Easy access to Wi-Fi, Night Mode, Rotation, USB Mass Storage, Restart/Exit, Search, and popular plugins like Z-Library, Calibre, Reading Streak, LocalSend, and File Browser.
*   **Native Customization Menu:** Injects seamlessly into KOReader's native settings menu (`Settings -> Quick settings`), allowing you to toggle slider visibility, enforce opening defaults, and reorder your button layout via a drag-and-drop sort widget.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Download the plugin:** Copy the `main.lua` file from this repository.
2.  **Access your device directory:** Connect your e-reader to your computer via USB, or use an SSH/SFTP connection.
3.  **Navigate to the plugins folder:** Go to the KOReader internal directory:
```bash
    koreader/plugins/
    ```
4.  **Create a plugin folder:** Create a new folder named `quicksettings.koplugin`:
```bash
    koreader/plugins/quicksettings.koplugin/
    ```
5.  **Place the file:** Paste the `main.lua` file inside that folder.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT ICON NOTE:** 
> * **If you are already using ZenUI:** The plugin tab icon will automatically be pulled from ZenUI. No extra steps are required.
> * **If you are NOT using ZenUI:** You **must** manually place an icon file named `quicksettings.svg` into your KOReader icons directory (`koreader/icons/`). Otherwise, the menu tab icon will not display correctly.
