# Quick Settings Plugin for KOReader

A native, clean, and highly customizable **Quick Settings Panel** for KOReader. This plugin combines a beautiful slider interface with an accessible control toggle panel.

This project is a hybrid merge of two excellent community resources, compiled, reworked, and optimized using AI assistance:
*   **ZenUI Sliders:** Derived from [AnthonyGress/zen_ui.koplugin](https://github.com/AnthonyGress/zen_ui.koplugin).
*   **Quick Settings Logic:** Derived from the `2-quick-settings.lua` patch found in [qewer33/koreader-patches](https://github.com/qewer33/koreader-patches).

## Disclaimer & Purpose

> **Note:** This plugin was originally put together purely for my **personal use** to streamline my own e-reader workflow. It is being shared publicly here because members of the community asked for it. 
> 
> As a personal project maintained in my spare time, it is provided "as-is." While you are more than welcome to use, fork, or modify it, please keep in mind that official support or frequent updates are not guaranteed.

 **Tested Device:** This plugin was developed and tested exclusively on a **Kindle Paperwhite 11/12 Signature Edition**. While it is designed to be compatible with other devices running KOReader, performance and layout rendering on other hardware cannot be guaranteed.

## Features

*   **Integrated Panel:** Combines your main navigation bar, quick toggle buttons, and frontlight sliders into a single unified menu view.
*   **ZenUI Sliders:** Upgrades the native KOReader frontlight/warmth bars with smooth, gesture-friendly pill-and-circle sliders.
*   **Dynamic Grid Layout:** Displays a perfectly proportioned single row when you select up to 7 buttons. If you enable more than 7 items, the plugin automatically adds new rows to accommodate your selection cleanly.
*   **Smart Hardware & Plugin Autodetection:** Optional buttons are hidden automatically unless their dependencies are met. Buttons for external plugins require those plugins to be installed, while specific hardware toggles (like frontlight and auto-rotation) only appear on devices that physically support those features.
*   **Robust Environment Compatibility:** Re-engineered internal plugin detection paths to work seamlessly across all platforms, including Kindle devices where working directories vary from the KOReader root.
*   **Native Customization Menu:** Injects seamlessly into KOReader's native settings menu (`Settings -> Quick settings`), allowing you to toggle slider visibility, enforce opening defaults, and reorder your button layout via a drag-and-drop sort widget.

 **Important Note on Core/External Plugins:** This plugin does **not** bundle any third-party tools or games (like Chess, Crossword, QuickRSS, etc.). It only acts as a control panel shortcut to trigger them. All dependent plugins must be downloaded and installed separately on your device for their respective buttons to appear.

## 🛠️ Installation & Upgrading

1.  **Download the plugin:** Download the latest version of this repository.
2.  **Access your device directory:** Connect your e-reader to your computer via USB, or use an SSH/SFTP connection.
3.  **Navigate to the plugins folder:** Go to the KOReader internal directory:
    ```bash
    koreader/plugins/
    ```
4.  **Create/Replace the plugin folder:** Ensure your folder is named exactly `quicksettings.koplugin`:
    ```bash
    koreader/plugins/quicksettings.koplugin/
    ```
5.  **Place the files:** Paste the `main.lua` file **and the accompanying `icons/` folder** inside `quicksettings.koplugin/`.

> **IMPORTANT TAB ICON NOTE:** 
> * **If you are already using ZenUI:** The main plugin tab icon will automatically be pulled from ZenUI. No extra steps are required.
> * **If you are NOT using ZenUI:** You **must** manually place an icon file into your KOReader icons directory at `/koreader/icons/quicksettings.svg` or `/koreader/icons/quicksettings.png`. Otherwise, the main menu tab icon will not display correctly.

6.  **Restart KOReader:** Safely eject your device or restart the KOReader software. *Note: If upgrading from an older version, your existing button sequence configuration will be automatically preserved and backfilled.*

## Localized Icon System & Customization

All button action icons now load locally directly from `plugins/quicksettings.koplugin/icons/` instead of polluting KOReader's global cache. 

### PNG → SVG Auto-Fallback
The asset loader automatically detects the file type. If a preferred `.png` icon is missing from the local folder, it will instantly fall back and look for the `.svg` variant at the same path. 

### Using Custom Icons
You can fully customize the interface by replacing the original images with your preferred graphics. The plugin manages icon loading locally from `plugins/quicksettings.koplugin/icons/`. Make sure to keep the exact filename (with the original `.png` extension or the automatic `.svg` fallback) as specified in the table below:
