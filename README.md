# Quick Settings Plugin for KOReader

A highly customizable, modular, and fast touch-based Quick Settings panel for KOReader. This plugin adds an intuitive mobile-like toggle dashboard to your e-reader's top menu bar, making it incredibly easy to switch profiles, control radios, launch plugins, and tweak your display on the fly.

***

### Key Features

* **Global Asset System:** All button icons have been moved back to the main `koreader/icons/` directory. The release pack already includes the required assets—simply place them into your system's root icons folder for clean system-wide integration.
* **Hardware-Adaptive Controls:** Includes intelligent toggles for **Frontlight Backlight** and **G-Sensor Auto-Rotation** that dynamically evaluate your device hardware capability—they will *only* display if your e-reader physically supports those components.
* **Dynamic Multifile Layout:** Buttons seamlessly arrange themselves side-by-side up to **7 items per row**. Once that structural limit is hit, the plugin automatically breaks into a clean new row. You don't have to keep all toggles active at once unless you want to!
* **Focus Mode Integration:** Hide distracting top menu bar tabs completely. Tap the **Focus Mode** button to pull up a checklist, choose which native KOReader tabs to hide (e.g., Typesetting, Tools, Navigation), and read completely distraction-free.
* **Extensive Plugin Support:** Acts as a centralized launcher interface for external tools. Natively supports tracking, running, or mapping state indicators for:
    * **FileBrowser+** (validates background PID status)
    * **BookFusion** (smart gateway based on active login state)
    * **LocalSend** (tracks active file transfer background servers)
    * **Calibre Companion & Search**
    * Reading Streak calendars, Advanced Battery Statistics, KOReader Progress History, Chess, Crosswords, NYT Connections, and OPDS Catalogs.
* **Fully Tested:** Performance and render pipelines are fully optimized for electronic paper displays, specifically benchmarked on the **Kindle Paperwhite 11/12 Signature Edition**.

### Installation Note

To install the plugin correctly, manually place the extracted files into the following specific directories on your device:

1. **Icons:** Copy all image assets (such as `.png` or `.svg` files) into the root global directory:
    ```path
    koreader/icons/
    ```
2. **Plugin Files:** Copy `main.lua` and the remaining script structure into the dedicated plugin folder:
    ```path
    koreader/plugins/quicksettings.koplugin/
    ```

Restart KOReader after placing the files to load the new settings dashboard interface cleanly.

### Special Appreciation & Credits
I want to express my deep, sincere gratitude once again to **[@AnthonyGress](https://github.com/AnthonyGress)** and **[@qewer33](https://github.com/qewer33)**. A massive portion of this plugin's underlying layout handling, tracking logic, and interface engine was derived directly from their incredible work and foundational open-source contributions to the KOReader development community.
